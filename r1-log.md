# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Kellen James]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a JS Password Visibility App. Worked on the event listener and toggle functionality. Could not get it working as expected, but it's about 90% there.

### R1D2
Got the JS Password Visibility App working and fully functional. I will be reviewing more optimized solutions later and probably adding CSS to make it look nicer! 

### R1D3
Small project to build updated version of the password toggle app - this time to toggle multiple passwords at the same time. Was able to implement forEach and converting node list to an array to get it working. Project was completed today. 

### R1D4
Today was review and optimization day from the project on R1D3. Learned mostly about how to convert a NodeList to an array and then using a forEach method to loop through that array. In addition, I spend some time reading articles about callbacks and worked on JS tutorials on Free Code Camp (while at work). 

### R1D5
Setup Project #3 - Multiple passwords, multiple forms. Setup basic structure of project and began thinking about the logic of how the application is going to function. 

### R1D6
Reviwed and optimized code from project #3 - multiple passwords, multiple forms. Learned how to use custom data-attributes properly and matches method.

### R1D7
Project #4 - Character Count. UI will display live character count as a user types in a textarea field (in progress). 

### R1D8
Project #4 - Character Count. Finished project and reviewed topics learned from it (many struggles). UI is now displaying live character count as the user types. 

### R1D9
Project #5 - Word-And-Character Count. Added additional functionality on top of previous project - this time the application will count the number of words with the individual characters. I was able to get the application functioning tonight!

### R1D10
Project #5 - Word-And-Character Count. Went back to revise, organize and clean up code. Biggest difference was adding in regex to the .split method to handle line breaks and spaces. App is 100% good to go. 

### R1D11
Project #6 - Word-And-Character Count. Went back to add ARIA markup for screen readers. Learned a decent amount about aria-live but couldn't get the screen reader to quite read out the full text the way I wanted. Will in the AM.

### R1D12
Project #6 - Refactored JS project from R1D11 to feature accesibility and ARIA markup attributes. Screen reader is now having an easier time reading the content displayed on the screen for impaired users. 

### R1D13
Today spent some time getting familiar with Promises and Fetch API - will be implementing in tomorrows project. 

### R1D14
Project #7 - Finished building random quote generator that utilizes Ron Swanson Quotes API. The app is full functional but code is not DRY. Will optimize code in the morning during review session. 

### R1D15
Project #8 - Refactored project #7 with added functionality. The challenge was to remove duplicate quotes in the array to create a better UX. Still working on this. 

### R1D16
Project #8 - Completed functionality that added removing duplicate quotes and emptying quotes array once 50 quotes was reached. 

### R1D17
Project #9 - Setup JS app to pull top news stories from NY Times API. Was able to succesfully pull top 39 articles by (title, section, abtract, and URL).

### R1D18
Project #10 - Finished first part of project, was able to pull top stories to pull from NYT API and inject onto the page.

### R1D19
Project #10 - Continued to struggle with methods on trying to loop through category names and then append to the page. 

### R1D20
Project #10 - Was able to pull 3-5 cateogires and 5 articles per category, but could not display all cateogires at the same time. After reviewing solution, I realized I was not too far off. #Progress

### R1D21
Today learned how to protect data from XSS attacks by sanitizing HTML - basically a smart and effective way to make sure you are not injecting malicious code unintentionally. This method was added to my NYT API Project. Sleep time

### R1D22
Spent some time reviewing sanitizing HTML methods and reinforcing JS fundamentals, reps over a sustained period of time = growth

### R1D23
Setup next JS project "Monster Shuffle" application where we will be using Fisher-Yates algorithm and working with SVG's.

### R1D24
Fell asleep last night after long day at work so work up early this morning to continue on this array manipulation JS "Monsters" application - getting closer to solving it ü§†

### R1D25
Reviewed solution for JS Monsters app and I learned that I was complicating the shiiiiiit out of it... Damn. See yuh 2moro üòÖ

### R1D26
Added more functionality to this lightweight Monster JS application. You choose the door, and unhide the monsters - until you find the sock. Then the game is over mothafka üòÇ still working on it.

### R1D27
Still working on lightweight Monsters JS app - learning more about array methods and UI rendering.

### R1D28
Finished reviewing solution to JS project "Find the Monsters and Track Wins". There is a lot of logic involved even with simple games. Learned a lot on this one üßê

### R1D29
Working on table-of-contents JS app. Need to convert nodeList to array and append dynamically to the page. I'd say, I'm about 80% there üòÆ

### R1D30
Finished first challenge of Table of Contents JS project. Learned how to convert a nodeList to an array, created a list of dynamic anchor links from that array and injected into the DOM. It was pretty cool ü•≥

### R1D31
Continued second part of challenge - Table of Contents JS Project (Missing ID's). During this challenge, there were HTML tags with Missing ID's. This challenge included modifying the existing script to support headings that don't have IDs on them. 

### R1D32
Project review day from previous day^ Learned how to properly implement RegEx pattern to replace missing ID's.

### R1D33
Next project: Table of Contenrs - Scope. This project was fairly straightforward. The challenge was to modify the Table of Contents script to keep it out of the global scope. I learned how to use an IIFE function. 

### R1D34
Reviewed solution on how to use IIFE within script. No changes were necessary. Will spend the rest of today on FCC challenges in the JavaScript section. 

### R1D35
Started next project - Weather App. Was successfully able to get the app functioning tonight. App pulls in the user's location and displays data in Farenheit. Very proud of myself for getting this up in a running in just a few hours, more updtes coming tomorrow :) 

### R1D36
Completed Weather JS Application. Attempted to build this a few months ago and was unsuccessful, but not today! This one is using multiple API requests - find's users location and displays current weather information.

### R1D37
Extending weather JS app to include plugin functionality. Still working on it but will give developers a few nice options out of the box to mess with.

### R1D38 - R1D39 
Reviewed solution to plugin functionality and started next project which is "Creating a Helper Library" with JS. This 100d challenge is no joke üòÇ

### R1D40 - R1D42 
Continued working on building helper and DOM manipulation libraries using revealing module and constructor patterns. I'm gettin a little lost in the sauce RN!!! ü§ñ

### R1D43-44 Light day today. 
Project review of mini JS DOM Manipulation library and HTML / CSS basics practiceeeeee.
