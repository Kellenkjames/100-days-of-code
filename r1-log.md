# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Kellen James]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a JS Password Visibility App. Worked on the event listener and toggle functionality. Could not get it working as expected, but it's about 90% there.

### R1D2
Got the JS Password Visibility App working and fully functional. I will be reviewing more optimized solutions later and probably adding CSS to make it look nicer! 

### R1D3
Small project to build updated version of the password toggle app - this time to toggle multiple passwords at the same time. Was able to implement forEach and converting node list to an array to get it working. Project was completed today. 

### R1D4
Today was review and optimization day from the project on R1D3. Learned mostly about how to convert a NodeList to an array and then using a forEach method to loop through that array. In addition, I spend some time reading articles about callbacks and worked on JS tutorials on Free Code Camp (while at work). 

### R1D5
Setup Project #3 - Multiple passwords, multiple forms. Setup basic structure of project and began thinking about the logic of how the application is going to function.
