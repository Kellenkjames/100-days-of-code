# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Kellen James]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a JS Password Visibility App. Worked on the event listener and toggle functionality. Could not get it working as expected, but it's about 90% there.

### R1D2
Got the JS Password Visibility App working and fully functional. I will be reviewing more optimized solutions later and probably adding CSS to make it look nicer! 

### R1D3
Small project to build updated version of the password toggle app - this time to toggle multiple passwords at the same time. Was able to implement forEach and converting node list to an array to get it working. Project was completed today. 

### R1D4
Today was review and optimization day from the project on R1D3. Learned mostly about how to convert a NodeList to an array and then using a forEach method to loop through that array. In addition, I spend some time reading articles about callbacks and worked on JS tutorials on Free Code Camp (while at work). 

### R1D5
Setup Project #3 - Multiple passwords, multiple forms. Setup basic structure of project and began thinking about the logic of how the application is going to function. 

### R1D6
Reviwed and optimized code from project #3 - multiple passwords, multiple forms. Learned how to use custom data-attributes properly and matches method.

### R1D7
Project #4 - Character Count. UI will display live character count as a user types in a textarea field (in progress). 

### R1D8
Project #4 - Character Count. Finished project and reviewed topics learned from it (many struggles). UI is now displaying live character count as the user types. 

### R1D9
Project #5 - Word-And-Character Count. Added additional functionality on top of previous project - this time the application will count the number of words with the individual characters. I was able to get the application functioning tonight!

### R1D10
Project #5 - Word-And-Character Count. Went back to revise, organize and clean up code. Biggest difference was adding in regex to the .split method to handle line breaks and spaces. App is 100% good to go. 

### R1D11
Project #6 - Word-And-Character Count. Went back to add ARIA markup for screen readers. Learned a decent amount about aria-live but couldn't get the screen reader to quite read out the full text the way I wanted. Will in the AM.

### R1D12
Project #6 - Refactored JS project from R1D11 to feature accesibility and ARIA markup attributes. Screen reader is now having an easier time reading the content displayed on the screen for impaired users. 

### R1D13
Today spent some time getting familiar with Promises and Fetch API - will be implementing in tomorrows project. 

### R1D14
Project #7 - Finished building random quote generator that utilizes Ron Swanson Quotes API. The app is full functional but code is not DRY. Will optimize code in the morning during review session. 

### R1D15
Project #8 - Refactored project #7 with added functionality. The challenge was to remove duplicate quotes in the array to create a better UX. Still working on this. 

### R1D16
Project #8 - Completed functionality that added removing duplicate quotes and emptying quotes array once 50 quotes was reached. 

### R1D17
Project #9 - Setup JS app to pull top news stories from NY Times API. Was able to succesfully pull top 39 articles by (title, section, abtract, and URL).

### R1D18
Project #9 - Finished first part of project, was able to pull top stories to pull from NYT API and inject onto the page.
