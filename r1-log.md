# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Kellen James]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a JS Password Visibility App. Worked on the event listener and toggle functionality. Could not get it working as expected, but it's about 90% there.

### R1D2
Got the JS Password Visibility App working and fully functional. I will be reviewing more optimized solutions later and probably adding CSS to make it look nicer!
